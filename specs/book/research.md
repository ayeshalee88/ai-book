# Research: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Current State of Embodied AI

### Key Concepts
- Embodied cognition: Intelligence emerges from interaction between agent and environment
- Sensorimotor coupling: Perception and action are tightly linked
- Morphological computation: Body shape and properties contribute to intelligent behavior
- Active inference: Agent acts to reduce uncertainty about its environment

### Foundational Research
- Rodney Brooks' subsumption architecture
- Andy Clark's extended mind thesis
- Alain Berthoz's notion of body schema
- Rolf Pfeifer's morphological computation
