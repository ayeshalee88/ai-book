# Complete Book Implementation

## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully completed the implementation of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. All remaining tasks in the tasks.md file have been completed:

- Phase 8 (User Story 6): Completed all tasks T043-T048 related to challenges-ethics and deployment sections
- Phase 9 (Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns): Completed all tasks T049-T058 including cross-references, accessibility improvements, index creation, code example verification, exercise solutions, quickstart validation, functionality testing, and deployment configuration

Updated tasks.md to mark all completed tasks with [x]. Validated the implementation against the original specification in book/spec.md and confirmed all required sections and content are present and well-structured. Created additional ignore files (.eslintignore, .prettierignore) for better project configuration. Added cross-references between related topics to improve navigation and learning experience.

The Docusaurus-based book is now complete with comprehensive coverage of embodied AI, humanoid robotics, AI integration, case studies, ethical considerations, and practical tutorials. All interactive elements, code examples, and exercises are properly documented and accessible.
