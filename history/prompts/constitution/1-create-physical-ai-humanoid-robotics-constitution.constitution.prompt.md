## Prompt

Create principles for a technical book titled "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World":
- Use clear, accessible language for engineers, researchers, and students, balancing theory with practical examples.
- Structure content hierarchically with chapters on fundamentals, integration techniques, case studies, and deployment, using Docusaurus MDX for interactivity.
- Include code snippets in Python, ROS, and relevant frameworks; ensure all examples are reproducible and focus on bridging digital AI (e.g., LLMs) with physical embodiments (e.g., sensors, actuators).
- Prioritize ethical considerations, safety in humanoid robotics, and real-world applications; reference credible sources or derive from first principles.
- Emphasize the goal of bridging the digital brain (AI algorithms) and physical body (robot hardware), with visuals like diagrams for sensorimotor loops.
- Maintain modularity for easy updates, SEO optimization, and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World" book with six core principles:
1. Accessible Technical Communication
2. Interactive Learning Experience
3. Reproducible Code Examples
4. Ethical and Safety First Approach
5. Digital-Physical Bridge Focus
6. Modular and Maintained Content

The constitution also includes Technical Standards, Educational Methodology, and Governance sections, all aligned with the specified requirements.

## Outcome
