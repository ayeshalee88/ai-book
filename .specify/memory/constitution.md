# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accessible Technical Communication
Technical content must balance theoretical depth with practical accessibility for engineers, researchers, and students. All concepts should be explained with clear language, intuitive examples, and hierarchical organization that builds from fundamentals to advanced applications.

### II. Interactive Learning Experience
Content must leverage Docusaurus MDX to create engaging, interactive experiences. Chapters should be structured hierarchically with fundamentals, integration techniques, case studies, and deployment guides that allow readers to explore concepts dynamically.

### III. Reproducible Code Examples
All code snippets in Python, ROS, and relevant frameworks must be tested and verified for reproducibility. Examples must bridge digital AI (e.g., LLMs) with physical embodiments (e.g., sensors, actuators) to demonstrate practical implementation of embodied intelligence.

### IV. Ethical and Safety First Approach
Ethical considerations and safety protocols must be integrated throughout all content. Humanoid robotics applications require explicit discussion of safety measures, responsible deployment, and societal impact, with references to credible sources and first principles.

### V. Digital-Physical Bridge Focus
Content must emphasize the connection between digital brains (AI algorithms) and physical bodies (robot hardware). Visual aids like diagrams for sensorimotor loops and control architectures should illustrate how intelligence manifests in physical form.

### VI. Modular and Maintained Content
All materials must be structured modularly for easy updates, SEO optimization, and GitHub Pages deployment. Documentation should support long-term maintenance and evolution of the content as technology advances.

## Technical Standards
All code examples must be in Python, ROS, and relevant robotics frameworks. Content should include comprehensive code samples, configuration files, and implementation guides that readers can directly apply to their projects.

## Educational Methodology
Content development must follow a pedagogical approach that combines theory with hands-on practice. Each concept should be introduced with foundational knowledge, followed by practical examples, and concluded with real-world applications and case studies.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World" book. All contributions must align with these principles. Updates to this constitution require explicit review and approval process documenting the rationale for changes.
