# AI Book RAG Chatbot UI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Production-Grade User Experience
The RAG chatbot UI must provide a professional, responsive, and intuitive interface for users to interact with the AI Book content. The UI should prioritize usability, accessibility, and performance to ensure a seamless querying experience.

### II. Seamless Backend Integration
The UI must integrate tightly with the existing backend RAG API (Qdrant-based) and Docusaurus book without requiring any backend changes. All API interactions must be robust, properly error-handled, and maintain compatibility with existing systems.

### III. Claude CLI-Driven Development
All UI components, wiring, and integration must be generated and managed through Claude CLI tools. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and leverages the full power of AI-assisted development workflows.

### IV. Zero-Configuration Deployment
The UI must be designed for easy deployment with minimal configuration requirements. It should work out-of-the-box with standard deployment platforms and integrate smoothly with existing CI/CD pipelines.

### V. Performance and Scalability Focus
The UI must be optimized for fast response times, efficient resource usage, and ability to scale with user demand. All components should be lightweight and implement proper caching and loading strategies.

### VI. Security and Privacy First
All user interactions and data handling must follow security best practices. The UI should properly handle authentication, protect user privacy, and ensure secure communication with backend services.

## Technical Standards
All code must follow modern web development standards using React/Next.js, TypeScript, and established UI libraries. The UI should implement proper state management, error boundaries, and follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA).

## User Experience Methodology
Development must follow a user-centered design approach that prioritizes the querying experience. Each feature should be designed with user workflows in mind, implement proper loading states, and provide clear feedback for all user actions.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development for the AI Book RAG Chatbot UI project. All contributions must align with these principles. Updates to this constitution require explicit review and approval process documenting the rationale for changes.
